<details> <summary>üß© Autopilot registration process</summary>

Your company uses Microsoft Intune to manage Windows devices. After purchasing laptops, you can register them in Intune using **Windows Autopilot**. There are two trusted paths: **Vendor Upload** and **IT Admin Upload**.

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Vendor Upload (OEM or Reseller)

**Best for:** Bulk purchases from authorized vendors like Dell, HP, Lenovo, etc.

### What You Provide
- **Tenant ID** (GUID format)
- **Tenant Domain** (e.g., `company.onmicrosoft.com`)

### What Vendor Does
- Extract hardware hashes from each device.
- Upload them to your Autopilot tenant via Microsoft‚Äôs OEM portal or Partner Center API.
- Optionally assign:
  - `Group Tag` (for profile targeting)
  - `Order ID`
  - `Assigned User`

> üì¶ Devices arrive pre-registered and ready for Autopilot provisioning.

---

### üõ† 2. IT Admin Upload (Manual or Scripted)

**Best for:** Internal setup, lab devices, or when vendor upload isn‚Äôt available.

### Steps to Collect and Upload Hardware Hash

1. Boot the device into Windows.
2. Run PowerShell to extract the hardware hash:
   ```powershell
   md c:\HWID
   Set-Location c:\HWID
   Install-Script -Name Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo
   Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -OutputFile AutopilotHWID.csv
</details>

# üìò Deployment & Enrollment in Intune

Understanding the difference between **deployment** and **enrollment** is essential for managing Windows devices with Microsoft Intune and Autopilot.

---

## üöÄ What Is Deployment?

> Deployment is the process of preparing and configuring a device before the user starts using it.

### üîß Deployment Includes:
- Applying **Autopilot profiles**
- Installing **apps and policies**
- Configuring **settings** (language, region, privacy)
- Branding the device (e.g., company logo, name)
- Joining the device to **Azure AD** or **Hybrid AD**

### üß≠ When It Happens:
- During **Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE)**
- Or via **Pre-provisioning** (White Glove)
<details>
  <summary>Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE)</summary>

- The device boots into a guided setup screen.
- The user selects:
  - Language
  - Region
  - Keyboard layout
- The device connects to Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
- If the device is registered with Windows Autopilot, it contacts the Autopilot service and:
  - Downloads its assigned deployment profile
  - Applies company branding and settings
  - Prompts the user to sign in with their Azure AD credentials
  - Automatically joins Azure AD and enrolls into Intune

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Or via Pre-provisioning (White Glove)</summary>

  Pre-provisioning allows IT to fully configure a Windows Autopilot device **before handing it to the end user**. It speeds up deployment by applying apps, policies, and settings in advance.

- IT boots the device into Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE)
- Connects to Wi-Fi or Ethernet
- Presses **Windows key + 5** to start pre-provisioning
- The device contacts the Autopilot service and:
  - Downloads its assigned deployment profile
  - Applies company branding and configuration
  - Installs required apps and policies
  - Validates setup and shows a green screen if successful
- IT shuts down the device
- End user powers on the device and sees:
  - Company branding
  - Sign-in screen
  - Fully configured environment

</details>

### üß© Deployment Methods:
- **User-driven Autopilot**
- **Self-deploying Autopilot**
- **Pre-provisioned Autopilot**
- **Provisioning Package (PPKG)**

---

## üîê What Is Enrollment?

> Enrollment is the process of connecting the device to Intune so it can be managed.

### üîß Enrollment Enables:
- Remote management via Intune
- Delivery of compliance policies and updates
- Monitoring and reporting
- Remote actions (wipe, retire, restart)

### üß≠ When It Happens:
- Automatically during Autopilot deployment
- Manually via Company Portal or PPKG
- Via GPO for Hybrid AD Join
- Through SCCM for co-managed devices

### üß© Enrollment Methods:
- **Autopilot Enrollment**
- **Azure AD Join + Auto-enroll**
- **Hybrid Azure AD Join + GPO**
- **Company Portal App**
- **Provisioning Package (PPKG)**
- **Co-management (SCCM + Intune)**

---

## üîÅ Summary Flow

```text
1. Register ‚Üí Upload device to Autopilot
2. Deploy   ‚Üí Configure device setup (OOBE, apps, policies)
3. Enroll   ‚Üí Connect device to Intune for management
4. Manage   ‚Üí Monitor, secure, and support the device






















<details>
  <summary>üß≠ Intune Enrollment Methods: How a device actually connects to Intune and becomes manageable.</summary>

  So once the device is registered (via vendor or admin), it still needs to enroll into Intune. Microsoft Intune supports multiple ways to register and manage Windows devices, depending on your environment and goals.

  ### üîê Enrollment Options

  | Method                        | Best For                          | Trigger Type         |
  |------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|
  | **Windows Autopilot**        | New corporate devices             | Hardware hash upload |
  | **Azure AD Join + MDM Auto-enrollment** | Cloud-first environments         | Automatic            |
  | **Hybrid Azure AD Join + GPO** | On-prem AD + Intune              | Automatic via GPO    |
  | **Company Portal App**       | BYOD or manual enrollment         | User-initiated       |
  | **Provisioning Package (PPKG)** | Offline or bulk setup             | Admin-initiated      |
  | **Co-management (SCCM + Intune)** | Existing SCCM-managed devices     | Admin-initiated      |

  ### üß© Key Scenarios

  - **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device):**  
    Users install the **Company Portal app**, sign in with their work account, and manually enroll.

  - **Hybrid Azure AD Join + GPO:**  
    Devices joined to on-prem AD can be auto-enrolled into Intune using **Group Policy** and **Azure AD Connect**.

  - **Offline Provisioning:**  
    Use **PPKG files** created with Windows Configuration Designer to enroll devices without internet during setup.

  - **Co-management:**  
    Organizations using **SCCM** can enable co-management to gradually shift workloads to Intune.

</details>


## üöÄ Deployment Scenarios
### 1. **Azure AD Join (Cloud-Only)**
- Devices are joined directly to Azure Active Directory.
- Ideal for cloud-first environments.
- Managed entirely via Intune.

<details>
  <summary>üí° Example Scenario: Azure AD Join</summary>

  Imagine you're deploying **20 new laptops** using **Microsoft Intune Autopilot**. Here's how the process works:

  1. Upload hardware hashes into Intune Autopilot.
  2. When users log in for the first time, devices automatically:
     - ‚úÖ Join Azure AD  
     - ‚úÖ Enroll in Intune  
     - ‚úÖ Install company policies and apps  
     - üéâ Done!

  üîí No need for on-premises Active Directory (AD) or a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

</details>

### 2. **Hybrid Azure AD Join**
- Devices are joined to on-premises AD and registered in Azure AD.
- Suitable for organizations using both on-prem and cloud resources.
- Requires Azure AD Connect.
<details>
  <summary>üåê Hybrid Azure AD Join: Full Scenario Overview</summary>

  ### üí° Real-World Setup

  Your company still has an on-premises Active Directory (AD) with servers, file shares, and Group Policies (GPOs).  
  You're also using Microsoft 365 and Intune for cloud management.

  **Environment Details:**
  - Domain Controller (on-prem): `corp.local`
  - Azure tenant: `company.onmicrosoft.com`
  - Azure AD Connect installed on-premises (syncs users and devices between AD ‚Üî Azure AD)
  - Devices are joined to the on-prem domain (classic domain join)

  ---

  ### ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Workflow

  1. **IT sets up the laptop manually or via imaging**
     - Joins it to the on-prem AD domain (`corp.local`)
     - Example:  
       ```
       Right-click This PC > Properties > Change settings > Domain: corp.local
       ```

  2. **Azure AD Connect syncs the device identity to Azure AD**
     - Azure AD now recognizes the device, though it's still managed by on-prem AD.

  3. **Auto-enrollment into Intune**
     - If GPO or MDM auto-enrollment is configured, the device registers with Intune.
     - Intune begins applying compliance and configuration policies.

  4. **User signs in**
     - Uses on-prem AD credentials (synced to Azure AD)
     - Device becomes a **Hybrid Azure AD Joined** device

  ---

  ### ‚úÖ Final Result

  - ‚úÖ Device is domain-joined (on-prem)
  - ‚úÖ Registered in Azure AD (cloud)
  - ‚úÖ Managed by Intune and possibly SCCM / GPO
  - ‚úÖ User can access:
    - File servers and printers (on-prem)
    - Microsoft 365 and cloud apps (Azure AD)
    - Intune policies and apps (cloud)
</details>

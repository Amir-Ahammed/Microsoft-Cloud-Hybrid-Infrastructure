## üîê Key Components

| Solution | Description | Best Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Active Directory (AD)** | Microsoft's traditional on-premises identity and access management system. Uses LDAP and Kerberos protocols. | Organizations with on-site infrastructure and Windows-based networks. |
| **Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly Azure AD) | A cloud-based identity platform for managing users, apps, and devices. Supports modern protocols like OAuth, OpenID Connect, and SAML. | Cloud-native or hybrid environments needing secure access to SaaS apps and mobile devices. |
| **Microsoft Entra Domain Services** | A managed domain service that provides domain join, group policy, and LDAP/Kerberos authentication‚Äîwithout needing to deploy domain controllers. | Organizations that want legacy AD features in the cloud without managing infrastructure. |

## üß† Why Use These Together?

Many organizations use a **combination** of these solutions to support both legacy systems and modern cloud apps:

- Use **AD** for on-prem servers.
- Use **Entra ID** for Office 365 and cloud apps.
- Use **Entra Domain Services** to extend AD-like capabilities into Azure without running domain controllers.

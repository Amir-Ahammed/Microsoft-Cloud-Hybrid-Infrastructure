## üîê Identity Fundamentals

- **Authentication**: Verifies identity (e.g., username + password).
- **Authorization**: Grants access to resources (e.g., open file, change settings).
- **Capabilities**: Management rights (e.g., admin privileges).

## üßë‚Äçüíª Local Identity Management

### üè† Windows Local Accounts
- Created during setup or manually.
- Stored in the local SAM database.
- Used for access to that device only.

### üë• Local Groups

Managed via:
- **Computer Management ‚Üí Local Users and Groups**
- **PowerShell**: `Get-LocalGroup`, `Add-LocalGroupMember`

| Group | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Administrators | Full control over the device. |
| Backup Operators | Can back up and restore files. |
| Event Log Readers | Can view system logs. |
| Guests | Limited access. |
| Users | Standard access. |
| Power Users | Elevated privileges, less than Admins. |
| Remote Desktop Users | Remote login access. |
| Network Config Operators | Manage network settings. |
| Replicator | Supports file replication. |
| Distributed COM Users | Launch/use DCOM objects. |
| Cryptographic Operators | Perform crypto operations. |
| Device Owners | Identified device owners. |
| Access Control Assist Operators | Query access permissions remotely. |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Assign users to the **least privileged group** necessary.

## üßô Special Identity Groups

| Group | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Anonymous Logon | Unauthenticated access. |
| Authenticated Users | Signed-in users. |
| Creator Owner | File/folder creator. |
| Everyone | All users, including guests. |
| Interactive | Local login users. |
| Network | Remote access users. |
| Service | Background service accounts. |
| System | Operating system identity. |

## üè¢ On-Premises AD Identity Management

### üå≥ Key Concepts
- **Hierarchical**: Forests, domains, OUs.
- **Group-Based Security**: Permissions via groups.
- **Group Policy**: Centralized configuration via GPOs.
- **Kerberos Authentication**: Secure, ticket-based SSO.

### üë• Group Types & Scopes

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Security | Assign permissions. | File shares, apps. |
| Distribution | Email only. | Exchange lists. |

| Scope | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Domain Local | Access within one domain. | Local resource access. |
| Global | Members from same domain. | Cross-domain access. |
| Universal | Members from any domain. | Forest-wide access.

### üîß Management Tools
- **ADUC** (GUI)
- **PowerShell**: `New-ADGroup`, `Add-ADGroupMember`
- **GPMC**: Group Policy Management Console

### üß© Membership Effects
- **Direct**: Immediate access.
- **Nested**: Scalable access via group nesting.
- **Transitive**: Universal groups support cross-domain nesting.
- **Access Control**: Affects files, folders, apps, GPOs.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Use Global for users, Domain Local for resources, Universal for cross-domain.

## üß† Best Practices

- Use **RBAC** to minimize over-permissioning.
- Sync **on-prem AD** with **Entra ID** for hybrid identity.
- Use **Entra Domain Services** for legacy app support.
- Audit **group memberships** and **access rights** regularly.
- Assign permissions via **groups**, not individual users.
- Use **PIM** for sensitive role access.

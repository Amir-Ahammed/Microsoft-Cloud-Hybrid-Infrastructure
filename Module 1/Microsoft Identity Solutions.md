# Microsoft Identity Solutions

## 🔐 Identity Fundamentals

- **Authentication**: Verifies identity (e.g., username + password).
- **Authorization**: Grants access to resources (e.g., open file, change settings).
- **Capabilities**: Management rights (e.g., admin privileges).

---

## 🧑‍💻 Local Identity Management

### 🏠 Windows Local Accounts
- Created during initial setup or manually.
- Stored in the local SAM (Security Account Manager) database.
- Used for access to **only that device**.

### 👥 Local Groups
- Used to assign permissions to multiple users.
- Managed via **Computer Management → Local Users and Groups** or PowerShell.

| Group | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Administrators | Full control over the device. |
| Backup Operators | Can back up/restore files. |
| Event Log Readers | Can view system logs. |
| Guests | Limited access. |

---

## 🧙 Special Identity Groups (Local & AD)

These are predefined identity groups in Windows and Active Directory environments. They are automatically created by the system and used to manage access control and permissions.

| Group | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Anonymous Logon** | Represents users who access resources without providing credentials. Common in public or unauthenticated scenarios. |
| **Authenticated Users** | Includes all users who have successfully signed in with valid credentials. More secure than "Everyone." |
| **Creator Owner** | Refers to the user who created a file or folder. Used to assign ownership-based permissions. |
| **Everyone** | Includes all users, including guests and anonymous users. Broadest group—use with caution. |
| **Interactive** | Represents users who are logged in locally to the computer (e.g., keyboard/mouse access). |
| **Network** | Represents users accessing the system remotely over the network (e.g., file shares, remote desktop). |
| **Service** | Represents services running under a service account. Used for background tasks and system services. |
| **System** | Represents the operating system itself. Has full access to all system resources and files. |

## 🏢 On-Premises AD Identity Management

### 🌳 AD Hierarchy
- **Forest**: Collection of domain trees.
- **Tree**: Hierarchical structure of domains.
- **Domain**: Logical boundary for users, groups, and resources.

### 👥 AD Group Types

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Security Group** | Assign permissions to resources. | File shares, printers, apps. |
| **Distribution Group** | Used for email distribution only. | Exchange mailing lists. |

### 📦 AD Group Scopes

| Scope | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Domain Local** | Used within a single domain. | Grant access to local resources. |
| **Global** | Members from same domain, usable across domains. | Department-level access. |
| **Universal** | Members from any domain in forest. | Enterprise-wide access across domains. |

### 🧬 Group Membership Effects

- **Direct Membership**: User inherits permissions assigned to the group.
- **Nested Groups**: Groups can be added to other groups (e.g., Sales → Marketing).
- **Transitive Membership**: Universal groups support nesting across domains.
- **Access Control**: Membership affects access to files, folders, apps, and policies.

> ⚠️ Best Practice: Use **Global groups for users**, **Domain Local groups for resources**, and **Universal groups for cross-domain access**.

## ☁️ Azure IaaS AD DS

- Deploy **Windows Server VMs** in Azure.
- Install and configure **Active Directory Domain Services**.
- Offers full control over domain controllers in the cloud.
- Ideal for lift-and-shift scenarios or hybrid environments.

---

## 🔄 Identity Synchronization

- Use **Azure AD Connect** to sync on-prem AD with Entra ID.
- Enables hybrid identity: users can access both on-prem and cloud resources.
- Supports password hash sync, pass-through authentication, and federation.

---

## 🛡️ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Assign roles based on job function.
- Roles define what actions users can perform.

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| Reader | View-only access |
| Contributor | Create/edit resources |
| Owner/Admin | Full control |

Used in:
- Microsoft Entra ID
- Microsoft 365 Admin Center
- Azure Resource Manager

---

## 🧭 Admin Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Computer Management** | Manage local users/groups |
| **PowerShell** | Scripted identity management |
| **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** | Manage cloud users/groups |
| **Microsoft Entra Admin Center** | Advanced identity governance |

---

## 🆚 Microsoft 365 vs Entra Admin Center

| Feature | Microsoft 365 Admin Center | Entra Admin Center |
|---------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| Interface | Simplified | Advanced |
| User Management | Basic | Granular |

| Role Assignment | Limited | Full RBAC & PIM |
| Governance | Minimal | Full lifecycle & access reviews |

## 🆚 Admin Center Comparison

| Feature | Microsoft 365 Admin Center | Entra Admin Center | Intune Admin Center |
|---------|----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Interface** | Simplified | Advanced | Policy-driven |
| **User Management** | Basic | Granular (RBAC, PIM) | Limited (focuses on devices) |
| **Group Types** | Microsoft 365 Groups, DLs | Security, Dynamic Groups | Uses Entra groups for targeting |
| **Role Assignment** | Limited | Full RBAC & PIM | Scoped roles for device admins |
| **Governance** | Minimal | Full lifecycle & access reviews | Compliance policies, conditional access |
| **Focus Area** | Collaboration & licensing | Identity, access, governance | Device, app, and endpoint security |
| **Key Capabilities** | License assignment, mailbox setup | Identity lifecycle, MFA, SSO | Device enrollment, app deployment, compliance enforcement |

## ☁️ Azure in Identity and Access Management

Azure is Microsoft’s cloud platform that hosts infrastructure, applications, and identity services. It integrates deeply with Entra ID and Intune to provide secure, scalable, and flexible identity solutions.

### 🔐 Key Identity Features in Azure

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Azure Active Directory (Entra ID)** | Cloud-based identity provider for apps, users, and devices. |
| **Azure AD Connect** | Syncs on-prem AD with Entra ID for hybrid identity. |
| **Azure RBAC** | Role-based access control for managing Azure resources. |
| **Azure Policy** | Enforces governance rules across subscriptions. |
| **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** | Just-in-time access for sensitive roles. |
| **Managed Identities** | Automatically managed credentials for Azure services. |
| **Conditional Access** | Enforces access policies based on user/device conditions. |

### 🧱 Azure IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

- Deploy **Windows Server VMs** and install **AD DS** for full control.
- Use **Azure Files**, **Azure Storage**, and **Azure Networking** with identity-based access.
- Integrate with **Entra Domain Services** for legacy support.

> Azure enables hybrid and cloud-native identity models, making it ideal for enterprises transitioning from on-prem to cloud.

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Use **RBAC** to avoid over-permissioning.
- Sync **on-prem AD** with **Entra ID** for hybrid identity.
- Use **Entra Domain Services** for legacy app support in cloud.
- Regularly audit **group memberships** and **access rights**.
- Avoid assigning permissions directly to users—use groups.
- Use **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** for just-in-time admin access.

### üîê Microsoft Entra Join ‚Äì Steps

1. **Start from OOBE (Out-of-Box Experience)** - On a new or reset Windows 10/11 device, choose *Set up for work or school*.
2. **Sign in with Entra ID credentials** - Enter your organization-provided work or school account (e.g., user@company.com).
3. **Device joins Microsoft Entra ID** - The device is automatically joined to your Entra tenant and a device object is created.
4. **Automatic Intune Enrollment (if configured)** - If MDM auto-enrollment is enabled, the device is enrolled into Intune for management.
5. **Local Administrator Group Update** - The local administrators group is modified to include the signed-in Entra ID user or Global Admins.
6. **SSO and Compliance Activation**  - Device receives configuration profiles, compliance policies, and enables SSO across Microsoft 365 and enterprise apps.

## üì± Microsoft Entra Register

**Used for: Personal devices (BYOD)**

### üîß Key Characteristics
- Device is *registered* to the Entra ID tenant.
- User signs in with personal account, but apps (e.g., Outlook, Teams) are linked to Entra ID.
- No full device management ‚Äî only app-level controls.
- Common on iOS, Android, macOS, and personal Windows devices.

### üì± Entra Register ‚Äì Impact

- **BYOD Flexibility**: Allows secure access from personal devices without full enrollment.
- **Lightweight Management**: Supports app-level Conditional Access and protection policies via Intune.
- **Improved Adoption**: Encourages productivity by enabling access to Teams, Outlook, and other apps on personal devices.
- **Limited Control**: No OS-level compliance enforcement; relies on app protection and sign-in risk policies.
- **Great for Mobile and Remote Work**: Ideal for contractors, mobile users, and hybrid work scenarios.
- **Local Sign-In Requirement**: User must sign in interactively using local user account.
- **Cloud Credential Prompt**: User must provide cloud credentials to access cloud content from local apps.
- **Unmodified Admin Group**: Device‚Äôs local Administrators group remains unchanged following device registration.

### üì± Microsoft Entra Register ‚Äì Steps

1. **Use a personal or BYOD device** - This can be a Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android device not managed by the organization.
2. **Open a Microsoft 365 app** - Launch Outlook, Teams, OneDrive, or any other Microsoft 365 app.
3. **Sign in with your Entra ID account** - Enter your work or school credentials (e.g., user@company.com) when prompted.
4. **Device registration occurs automatically** - A lightweight device object is created in Microsoft Entra ID.
5. **App-level policies are applied** - Conditional Access and Intune app protection policies (e.g., data encryption, copy/paste restrictions) are enforced.
6. **No OS-level control or enrollment** - The device remains unmanaged; no compliance policies or full lifecycle control.
7. **Local admin group remains unchanged** - The device‚Äôs local Administrators group is not modified.
8. **Cloud access requires credentials** - Users must sign in interactively using their local account and provide cloud credentials to access Microsoft 365 content.

## üß© Microsoft Entra Hybrid Join

### üßë‚Äçüíº Used For:
- Domain-joined Windows devices in organizations with both on-premises AD and cloud services.
- Enterprises transitioning to cloud while retaining legacy infrastructure.
- Scenarios requiring access to both cloud apps (Microsoft 365, Intune) and on-prem resources (file shares, printers).

---

### üîß Key Characteristics

- Device is joined to **on-premises Active Directory** and **registered with Microsoft Entra ID** via sync.
- Enables **SSO to cloud and on-premises apps** using Primary Refresh Tokens (PRT).
- Requires **Microsoft Entra Connect** to sync device objects to Entra ID.
- Supports **Conditional Access** and **Intune enrollment** (if configured).
- Can be configured through **Windows Autopilot in Intune with the intune Connector** for Active Directory
- Maintains compatibility with **Group Policy**, **Configuration Manager**, and legacy tools.
- Ideal for **existing domain-joined devices** that need cloud access without full migration.

---

### üìä Hybrid Join ‚Äì Impact

- **Dual Identity Integration**: Devices operate in both AD and Entra ID environments.
- **SSO Across Platforms**: Users get seamless access to cloud and on-prem apps.
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Supports GPOs, SCCM, and traditional AD-based workflows.
- **Cloud Policy Extension**: Enables Conditional Access and compliance policies via Entra ID.
- **Transition Strategy**: Useful for phased migration to cloud-native management.
- **Requires Infrastructure**: Depends on Entra Connect and domain controller availability.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Do Hybrid Join (Steps)

1. **Prepare Microsoft Entra Connect**:
   - Install and configure Entra Connect on a server.
   - Ensure version 1.1.819.0 or later is used.
   - Enable device writeback and sync required Organizational Units (OUs).

2. **Configure Sync Rules**:
   - Do not exclude default device attributes.
   - Ensure computer objects are included in sync scope.

3. **Verify Domain Configuration**:
   - For managed domains: use password hash sync or seamless SSO.
   - For federated domains: configure AD FS and device registration.

4. **Join Devices to AD**:
   - Devices must be domain-joined (via GPO, manual, or provisioning).

5. **Sync Devices to Entra ID**:
   - Entra Connect syncs device objects to Entra ID.
   - Devices become Hybrid Joined automatically.

6. **Validate Join Status**:
   - Run `dsregcmd /status` on client device.
   - Check `AzureAdJoined` and `DomainJoined` both show `YES`.

# Plan and implement groups for device in Microsoft Entra ID

## Why Use Groups?
- Groups enable you to configure settings and assign security permission and rights to collections of Users & Devices
- Groups simplify ongoing administration of both Users & Devices
- You can assign RBAC roles to groups. 

### Groups Membership can be:
- Assigned
- Dynamic

### There are Five different group typs:
In genarally you will see the following groups togather in **MS 365 Admin Center** only and in **Intune** and **Entra** you will only see **Security** and **MS365** groups.
- Security
- Mail-enabled security groups
- Microsoft 365
- Teams
- Distribution Lists

## Managing Groups
- Microsoft 365 admin center
- Microsoft Entra Admin center
- Microsoft Intune Admin center
- Windows PowerShell

## Why Use Device Groups?
Simplify management of devices by enabling you to:
- Assign configuration profiles to multiple devices
- Deploy app to multiple devices
- Configure app settings across multiple devices
- Assgn compliance policies to multiple devices

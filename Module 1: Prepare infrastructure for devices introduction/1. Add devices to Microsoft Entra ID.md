|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Security**             | Limited to app-level Conditional Access; no full device compliance.    |
| **User Experience**      | Users use personal credentials; apps prompt for Entra ID sign-in.      |
| **IT Management**        | No full device control; only app protection policies via Intune.       |
| **Compliance**           | Cannot enforce OS-level policies; relies on app-level safeguards.      |
| **Zero Trust Alignment** | Partial support; useful for enabling secure access on BYOD.            |

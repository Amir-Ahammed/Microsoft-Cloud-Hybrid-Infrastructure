## üì± Microsoft Entra Register

**Used for: Personal devices (BYOD)**

### üîß Key Characteristics

- User signs in with personal account, but apps (e.g., Outlook, Teams) are linked to Entra ID.
- No full device management ‚Äî only app-level controls.
- Common on iOS, Android, macOS, and personal Windows devices.

### üì± Entra Register ‚Äì Impact

| Area                     | Impact                                                                 |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Security**             | Limited to app-level Conditional Access; no full device compliance.    |
| **User Experience**      | Users use personal credentials; apps prompt for Entra ID sign-in.      |
| **IT Management**        | No full device control; only app protection policies via Intune.       |
| **Compliance**           | Cannot enforce OS-level policies; relies on app-level safeguards.      |
| **Zero Trust Alignment** | Partial support; useful for enabling secure access on BYOD.            |

## üß† Decision Guide

| Question                             | Recommended Identity Model     |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|

| Is the device personal/BYOD?        | Entra Register                 |
| Do you need full device management? | Entra Join                     |
| Is app-level control sufficient?    | Entra Register                 |

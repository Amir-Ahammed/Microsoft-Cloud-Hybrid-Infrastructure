# Overview of Microsoft Identity Solutions <a name="overview-of-microsoft-identity-solutions">
**Microsoft Identity Solutions provide a unified framework for managing user identities, access permissions, and authentication across local devices, on-premises networks, and cloud environments. These solutions enable secure, scalable, and flexible identity management for organizations of all sizes.**

---

### Identity Fundamentals

- **Authentication**: Verifying user identity using credentials or tokens (e.g., username + password).
- **Authorization**: Granting access to resources based on roles and policies (e.g., open file, change settings).
- **Governance**: Controlling lifecycle, compliance, and privileged access.

### Identity Models

- **Windows Local Identity**: Device-specific accounts and groups.
- **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**: Centralized on-premises identity infrastructure.
- **Microsoft Entra ID**: Cloud-native identity provider for SaaS and enterprise apps.
- **Microsoft Entra Domain Services**: Managed domain services in Azure for legacy app support.
- **Azure IaaS AD DS**: Full AD deployment on cloud-hosted Windows Server VMs.

> Microsoft‚Äôs identity ecosystem supports hybrid environments, enabling seamless integration between on-premises and cloud systems while enforcing modern security practices like Conditional Access, MFA, and Zero Trust.

---

## Windows Local Accounts
Windows Local Accounts are user identities created and stored directly on a specific Windows device. They are not connected to any domain or cloud identity provider, making them ideal for standalone systems or simple environments.

### Key Characteristics

- Stored in the **Security Account Manager (SAM)** database on the local machine.
- Used for **authentication and access control** on that device only.
- Can be created during setup or manually via **Settings** or **Computer Management**.
- Supports **local password policies**, but lacks centralized management or synchronization.

### Group Types

| Group Type | Description | Use Case |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Local Groups | Built-in groups for assigning permissions on a single device. | File system access, service control, remote desktop permissions |
| Special Identity Groups | System-defined identities used in access control lists (ACLs). Not manually created or managed. | OS-level access control, service permissions, anonymous or network logon contexts |

### Group Scopes

- ‚ùå No domain or forest structure.
- All groups are **local to the device**.

### Local Groups

Local groups are used to assign permissions to multiple users on a single device. They are managed via:

- **Computer Management ‚Üí Local Users and Groups**
- **PowerShell (`Get-LocalGroup`, `Add-LocalGroupMember`)**

### Common Local Groups

| Group               | Purpose |
|---------------------|---------|
| **Administrators**      | Full control over the device. |
| **Backup Operators**    | Can back up and restore files. |
| **Event Log Readers**   | Can view system logs. |
| **Guests**              | Limited access to the system. |
| **Users**               | Standard access to use apps and files. |
| **Power Users**         | More privileges than Users, less than Administrators. |
| **Remote Desktop Users**| Can log in remotely using Remote Desktop. |
| **Network Configuration Operators** | Can manage network settings. |
| **Replicator**          | Supports file replication services. |
| **Distributed COM Users** | Can launch and use DCOM objects. |
| **Cryptographic Operators** | Can perform cryptographic operations. |
| **Device Owners**       | Identified as owners of the device. |
| **Access Control Assistance Operators** | Can remotely query access permissions. |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Always assign users to the **least privileged group** necessary to perform their tasks. This helps maintain system security and stability.

### Special Identity Groups

These are predefined identity groups in Windows and Active Directory environments. They are automatically created by the system and used to manage access control and permissions.

| Group | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Anonymous Logon** | Represents users accessing resources without credentials. |
| **Authenticated Users** | All users who have signed in successfully. |
| **Creator Owner** | Refers to the user who created a file or folder. |
| **Everyone** | Includes all users, including guests and anonymous. |
| **Interactive** | Users logged in locally to the computer. |
| **Network** | Users accessing the system remotely. |
| **Service** | Represents services running under service accounts. |
| **System** | Represents the operating system itself. |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è They're not really groups, they're categorizations of Users.

### Membership Effects

- **Direct Membership**: Users added to local groups inherit permissions on that device.
- **No Nesting Support**: Local groups do not support nested group structures.
- **Access Control**: Membership affects access to local files, folders, services, and system features.
- **Special Identity Groups**: Automatically assigned based on login context (e.g., Network, Interactive).

## On-Premises AD Identity Management

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is Microsoft‚Äôs on-premises identity and access management system. It provides centralized control over users, groups, devices, and resources.

### Key Characteristics

- **Hierarchical and Granular**: AD is structured like a tree with forests, domains, and organizational units (OUs). This allows fine-grained control over resources and policies.
- **Security Based on Groups**: Permissions are assigned to groups rather than individual users. This simplifies access control and improves scalability.
- **Group Policy Administration**: AD uses Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to enforce settings across users and computers (e.g., password policies, desktop restrictions).
- **Kerberos Authentication**: AD uses the Kerberos protocol for secure, ticket-based authentication. It‚Äôs fast, secure, and supports single sign-on (SSO).

### Group Types

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Security Group** | Used to assign permissions to resources. | File shares, printers, apps. |
| **Distribution Group** | Used for email distribution only. | Exchange mailing lists. |

### Group Scopes

| Scope | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Domain Local** | Used within a single domain. | Grant access to local resources. |
| **Global** | Members from same domain, usable across domains. | Department-level access. |
| **Universal** | Members from any domain in forest. | Enterprise-wide access across domains.

### Group Management Tools

- **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**: GUI tool for managing users, groups, and OUs.
- **PowerShell**: Scripted management using cmdlets like `New-ADGroup`, `Add-ADGroupMember`, `Get-ADGroup`.
- **GPMC**: Group Policy Management Console

### Membership Effects

- **Direct Membership**: User inherits permissions assigned to the group.
- **Nested Groups**: Groups can be added to other groups for scalable access control.
- **Transitive Membership**: Universal groups support nesting across domains.
- **Access Control**: Membership affects access to files, folders, apps, and GPOs.

### Authentication Protocol

- **Kerberos**: Default protocol used in AD DS. Provides secure, ticket-based authentication.
- **NTLM**: Legacy protocol, still supported but less secure.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Best Practice: Use **Global groups for users**, **Domain Local groups for resources**, and **Universal groups for cross-domain access**.

## Cloud Identity Management

Cloud identity solutions extend identity and access management beyond traditional on-premises environments. These services are designed for scalability, security, and integration with modern apps and infrastructure.

### üîê Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)

Microsoft Entra ID is a **cloud-based identity provider** used to manage users, groups, devices, and access to SaaS applications.

#### Key Features
- Single Sign-On (SSO) for Microsoft 365, Zoom, Salesforce, etc.
- Supports OAuth2, OpenID Connect, SAML protocols.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for apps and resources.
- Conditional Access policies for secure authentication.
- Identity Governance: Access reviews, entitlement management, lifecycle workflows.

#### User Management
- Create users manually or sync from on-prem AD via Azure AD Connect.
- Assign licenses (e.g., Microsoft 365, Intune).
- Configure user attributes, roles, and MFA settings.
- Delegate access using **RBAC** and **PIM**.

#### Group Types
- Groups Can Contain Users or Devices
- Group Membership can be:
  - Assigned
  - Dynamic (Required Entra Premium)
  
| Group Type | Description | Use Case |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Security Group** | Assign access to apps and resources. | Conditional Access, app targeting (e.g., SharePoint, Teams) |
| **Microsoft 365 Group** | Collaboration group with mailbox, Teams, Planner. | Team-based collaboration |
| **Dynamic Group** | Auto-membership based on attributes. (Assigned/Dynamic are Membership Type, It can be modify during Group Creation)| Auto-grouping by department, location (e.g., department = Sales) |
| **Distribution Group** | Email distribution only. (Can be created by MS365 admin center) | Exchange Online mailing lists |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Dynamic groups in Entra ID are available only for Security and Microsoft 365 Groups.

#### Group Scopes

- ‚ùå No Domain Local, Global, or Universal scopes.
- All groups are **tenant-wide** and operate across the entire Entra tenant.

#### Membership Effects

- **Direct Membership**: Users explicitly added to a group inherit permissions and access assigned to that group. 
- **Dynamic Membership**: Users are automatically added/removed based on attributes (e.g., department, job title). Managed via rules. 
- **Role Assignment**: Group membership can be used to assign roles (e.g., Entra roles, Intune roles, Azure RBAC roles). 
- **Access Control**: Membership affects access to apps, Conditional Access policies, license assignments, and resource targeting. 
- **App Assignment**: Groups can be used to assign access to enterprise applications (e.g., Salesforce, Zoom, SharePoint). 
- **Policy Targeting**: Groups are used to scope Conditional Access, compliance policies, and Intune configurations. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Entra ID does not support nested groups in the same way as AD DS. While some apps (like Exchange Online) may support nested group resolution, Entra ID itself treats group membership as flat.

#### Group Management Tools
- Microsoft 365 admin center / Entra Admin Center / Intune Admin Center
- PowerShell (`New-AzureADGroup`, `Add-AzureADGroupMember`)
- Microsoft Graph API

---

## What Is RBAC in Microsoft Entra ID?
RBAC in Entra ID allows organizations to grant **just the right level of access** to manage identity resources‚Äîsuch as users, groups, devices, applications, and policies‚Äîwithout giving unnecessary permissions. It‚Äôs a core part of Microsoft Entra‚Äôs identity governance and security strategy.

- **RBAC** is the framework, and Entra roles are the tools used within that framework.
- Microsoft Entra implements **RBAC** by assigning roles to users, groups, or service principals to manage identity-related tasks.

> ### üìå Example
> Assigning the User Administrator role to a helpdesk technician is an application of RBAC using an Entra role.

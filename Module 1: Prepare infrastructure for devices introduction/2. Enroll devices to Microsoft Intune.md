# ðŸŒ€ Microsoft Intune Device Management Lifecycle

The **Intune Device Management Lifecycle** describes the complete journey of a device â€” from enrollment to retirement â€” managed through **Microsoft Intune**.  


## 1. Device Enrollment (Register / Join)

**Purpose:** Bring the device under Intune management.

**Common Enrollment Methods:**
- **Windows Autopilot:** Pre-provisioned new devices from OEM.
- **Azure AD Join (Cloud-Only):** For cloud-native devices.
- **Hybrid Azure AD Join:** Domain-joined devices synced with Azure AD.
- **BYOD Enrollment:** User-enrolled personal devices.
- **Apple DEP / Android Zero-Touch:** Automated enrollment for corporate mobile devices.

> ðŸ“Œ **Outcome:** The device is registered in Intune and linked to a user or organization.


## 2. Device Configuration

Once enrolled, IT applies device configurations and security policies.

**Examples:**
- Security baselines (password, BitLocker, Defender)
- Wi-Fi, VPN, and email profiles
- Compliance policies (OS version, encryption, root detection)
- Custom configuration profiles (CSPs, PowerShell scripts)

> ðŸ“Œ **Goal:** Ensure devices meet organizational and security standards.


## 3. Application Deployment

Intune manages and deploys applications to devices.

**App Types:**
- **Microsoft 365 apps** (Teams, OneDrive, Office)
- **Line-of-Business (LOB)** apps (custom enterprise apps)
- **Store apps** (Microsoft Store, Google Play, Apple App Store)
- **Web links or Win32** apps (via Intune Management Extension)

> ðŸ“Œ **Goal:** Deliver required business applications securely.


## 4. Device Protection & Monitoring

After deployment, Intune continuously monitors compliance and security.

**Includes:**
- **Conditional Access:** Blocks non-compliant devices.
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration**
- **Compliance monitoring and alerts**
- **Reports in Intune Admin Center**

> ðŸ“Œ **Goal:** Maintain device health, compliance, and protection.

## 5. Update & Maintenance

Ongoing lifecycle management ensures devices remain secure and current.

**Includes:**
- **Windows Update for Business**
- **Patch deployment** (OS & apps)
- **Policy updates and re-evaluations**

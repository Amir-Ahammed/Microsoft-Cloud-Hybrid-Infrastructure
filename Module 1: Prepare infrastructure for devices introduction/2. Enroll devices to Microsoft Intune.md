# 🌀 Microsoft Intune Device Management Lifecycle

The **Intune Device Management Lifecycle** describes the complete journey of a device — from enrollment to retirement — managed through **Microsoft Intune**.  


## 1. Device Enrollment (Register / Join)

**Purpose:** Bring the device under Intune management.

**Common Enrollment Methods:**
- **Windows Autopilot:** Pre-provisioned new devices from OEM.
- **Azure AD Join (Cloud-Only):** For cloud-native devices.
- **Hybrid Azure AD Join:** Domain-joined devices synced with Azure AD.
- **BYOD Enrollment:** User-enrolled personal devices.
- **Apple DEP / Android Zero-Touch:** Automated enrollment for corporate mobile devices.

> 📌 **Outcome:** The device is registered in Intune and linked to a user or organization.


## 2. Device Configuration

Once enrolled, IT applies device configurations and security policies.

**Examples:**
- Security baselines (password, BitLocker, Defender)
- Wi-Fi, VPN, and email profiles
- Compliance policies (OS version, encryption, root detection)
- Custom configuration profiles (CSPs, PowerShell scripts)

> 📌 **Goal:** Ensure devices meet organizational and security standards.


## 3. Application Deployment

Intune manages and deploys applications to devices.

**App Types:**
- **Microsoft 365 apps** (Teams, OneDrive, Office)
- **Line-of-Business (LOB)** apps (custom enterprise apps)
- **Store apps** (Microsoft Store, Google Play, Apple App Store)
- **Web links or Win32** apps (via Intune Management Extension)

> 📌 **Goal:** Deliver required business applications securely.


## 4. Device Protection & Monitoring

After deployment, Intune continuously monitors compliance and security.

**Includes:**
- **Conditional Access:** Blocks non-compliant devices.
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration**
- **Compliance monitoring and alerts**
- **Reports in Intune Admin Center**

> 📌 **Goal:** Maintain device health, compliance, and protection.

## 5. Update & Maintenance

Ongoing lifecycle management ensures devices remain secure and current.

**Includes:**
- **Windows Update for Business**
- **Patch deployment** (OS & apps)
- **Policy updates and re-evaluations**
- **Inventory and reporting**

# Device Enrollment

This note explains how to configure device enrollment in **Microsoft Intune** for each supported platform — **Windows**, **macOS**, **iOS/iPadOS**, **Android**, and **Linux**.

## Prerequisites (Must-Haves)

These are mandatory for enrollment to succeed:

- **Intune License**: Assigned via Microsoft 365 E3/E5, EMS E3/E5, or standalone Intune.
- **Microsoft Entra ID Tenant**: All users and devices must exist in the tenant.
- **MDM Authority**: Intune must be set as the Mobile Device Management authority.
- **Verified Custom Domain**: Enables branded UPNs (e.g., `user@yourcompany.com`).
- **Supported OS Versions**:
  - iOS/iPadOS 15.0+
  - macOS 13.0+
  - Android 8.0+, Android Enterprise, AOSP
  - Windows 10/11 (Home, S, Pro, Education, Enterprise, IoT)
  - Windows 10/11 Cloud PCs (Windows 365)
  - Windows 10 LTSC 2019/2021
  - Surface Hub
  - Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 / 22.04
- **Network Access**: Devices must reach Intune and Entra endpoints.

## Preparing to Device Enrollment
Before enrolling devices into Microsoft Intune, make sure the following settings are configured and ready.

### Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) – Settings
- **Device → Device Settings:**
  - **Users may join devices to Azure AD**  → Set to **Selected** or **All** → Allows device join (needed for Autopilot, AAD Join)
  - **Users may register their devices with Azure AD** → Set to **All** *(can be managed with Conditional Access)* → Needed for mobile/BYOD enrollments.  
  - **Require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** → **Enable** *(can be managed with Conditional Access)* → Adds security during device join.
  - **Maximum number of devices per user** → Adjust (default 50; recommended 10–20). → Prevents users from joining unlimited devices.
  - **Additional local administrators on AAD-joined devices**  → Add **IT Admin Group** only. → Controls who becomes a local admin.
- *(Optional)* **Enterprise State Roaming** → Enable if you want user settings to sync between AAD-joined devices
- **Custom Domain** (e.g., `company.com`) verified and configured → Ensures user logins match your company identity.
- **Company Branding** → Add logo, background, sign-in text. → Improves user trust and sign-in experience.
- **User Licenses** → Assign Intune / M365 E3/E5 licenses to each enrolling user.  

### Microsoft Intune – Settings

- **Devices | Enrollment**:
  - **Device Enrollment Manager (DEM)** → DEM is a user account with special permission to enroll up to 1,000 devices into Intune. You can have up to 150 DEM accounts in your tenant.
  - **Device Categories**  → Tag devices (e.g., Sales, IT, HR) for policy targeting.
- **Tenant Administration**:
  - **Set MDM Authority** → Must be *Microsoft Intune* → Defines Intune as your device management service
  - **Company Portal Customization** → Add your logo, IT support email, and help links
  - **Create Device Compliance Policies** → Define rules for OS version, encryption, antivirus, password, etc.
  - **Terms and Conditions** → Ensure users accept your organization’s usage and security policies before accessing corporate resources.

## Windows Enrollment
Windows Enrollment is the process of registering and managing Windows devices in Intune so that IT can apply policies, apps, and compliance rules.

### Enrollment Methods

| Enrollment Method | Ownership Type | Best For | Description |
|--------------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Windows Autopilot** | Corporate | New devices (OOBE setup) | Simplifies deployment by preconfiguring devices from the vendor to automatically enroll into Intune. |
| **Azure AD Join (Cloud-only)** | Corporate | Remote or cloud-first environments | Device joins Azure AD directly and automatically enrolls in Intune. |
| **Hybrid Azure AD Join** | Corporate | On-prem AD + Intune environments | Devices join on-prem AD, then sync to Azure AD and enroll into Intune. |
| **Bulk Enrollment (Provisioning Package)** | Corporate / Shared | Kiosks, labs, or shared devices | Use Windows Configuration Designer to create a provisioning package (*.ppkg*) for offline or mass enrollment. 
| **Co-management (SCCM + Intune)** | Corporate | Transition phase from SCCM to Intune | Devices managed by SCCM can also be connected to Intune for cloud-based management. |
| **Manual Enrollment (Settings app)** | BYOD / Personal | Personal devices or test devices | User goes to *Settings → Accounts → Access work or school → Connect*, and signs in with company credentials. |
| **Windows Autopilot for existing devices** | Corporate | Devices already in use | Used to reset and reconfigure existing devices for new users while keeping enrollment automated. |

# Manage Roles in Intune (Role-Based Access Control in Entra ID)
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is the system used to delegate administrative permissions within Microsoft Intune. It is built on and integrated with Microsoft Entra ID. To ensure the principle of least privilege by granting users or groups only the permissions they absolutely need to perform their jobs.

## Key Capabilities:
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Entra ID uses RBAC to assign permissions based on roles rather than individual user settings. This simplifies management and improves security.
- **Built-in roles**: Microsoft provides over 100 predefined roles like Global Administrator, User Administrator, Application Administrator, and Security Reader. Each has specific permissions tailored to common tasks
- **Custom roles**: Organizations can create custom roles with granular permissions to meet unique operational needs.
- **Role assignment**: Roles can be assigned to users, groups, or service principals. Assignments can be scoped to the entire tenant or limited to specific administrative units or resources.
- **Just-In-Time (JIT) role activation**: Enables time-bound, approval-based access to privileged roles via Entra ID's Privileged Identity Management (PIM), enforcing least privilege with MFA, audit logging, and reduced standing access.
- **Least privilege principle**: Entra ID encourages assigning only the minimum necessary permissions to reduce risk and improve compliance.

## "Privileged" Roles
Roles marked as **Privileged** have elevated access that can impact tenant-wide configurations and security. These roles should be governed with extra caution:

- **Elevated Access**: Can manage sensitive resources like identity settings, enterprise apps, and security configurations.
- **Governance via PIM**: Supports JIT access, approval workflows, and audit trails.
- **Examples**:
  - Global Administrator
  - Application Administrator
  - Security Administrator
  - Privileged Role Administrator

# Manage Roles in Intune (Role-Based Access Control in Entra ID)
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is the system used to delegate administrative permissions within Microsoft Intune. It is built on and integrated with Microsoft Entra ID. To ensure the principle of least privilege by granting users or groups only the permissions they absolutely need to perform their jobs.

## Key Capabilities:
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Entra ID uses RBAC to assign permissions based on roles rather than individual user settings. This simplifies management and improves security.
- **Built-in roles**: Microsoft provides over 100 predefined roles like Global Administrator, User Administrator, Application Administrator, and Security Reader. Each has specific permissions tailored to common tasks
- **Custom roles**: Organizations can create custom roles with granular permissions to meet unique operational needs.
- **Role assignment**: Roles can be assigned to users, groups, or service principals. Assignments can be scoped to the entire tenant or limited to specific administrative units or resources.
- **Just-In-Time (JIT) role activation**: Enables time-bound, approval-based access to privileged roles via Entra ID's Privileged Identity Management (PIM), enforcing least privilege with MFA, audit logging, and reduced standing access.
- **Least privilege principle**: Entra ID encourages assigning only the minimum necessary permissions to reduce risk and improve compliance.

## "Privileged" Roles
Roles marked as **Privileged** have elevated access that can impact tenant-wide configurations and security. These roles should be governed with extra caution:

- **Elevated Access**: Can manage sensitive resources like identity settings, enterprise apps, and security configurations.
- **Governance via PIM**: Supports JIT access, approval workflows, and audit trails.
- **Examples**:
  - Global Administrator
  - Application Administrator
  - Security Administrator
  - Privileged Role Administrator

# Implement compliance policies
# Implement Conditional Access policies
## What is Conditional Access
**Conditional Access (CA)** is a security feature in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) that helps control how users access cloud apps and resources based on specific conditions. When integrated with Intune, it adds device compliance and app management signals to the decision-making process. 
- **Purpose**: Protect organizational resources by allowing access only when specific conditions are met.
- **Signals used**: User/group, device compliance, location, app sensitivity, sign-in risk, etc.

> **Example**: If a user logs in from outside the office or from an unmanaged laptop, then require MFA or block access. <br>
> It combines identity, device, location, and app signals to protect access.

## Common Scenarios for Conditional Access
- **Require compliant device**: Only allow access to M365 apps if the device meets Intune compliance policies.
- **Restrict access by location**: Block access from non-corporate or geo-restricted IPs.
- **App-based CA**: Allow access only via approved apps like Outlook mobile.
- **Based on network location**: Allow access only from trusted IP ranges (e.g., corporate VPN or office IPs); block or enforce MFA for unknown networks.
- **Based on device trust**: Grant access only if the device is hybrid Azure AD joined or marked as trusted (e.g., via certificate or compliance state).

## Compliance with or without Conditional Access

| Scenario                    | Behavior                                                                 |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **With Conditional Access**    | Access is granted only if the device is compliant with Intune policies (e.g., encryption, OS version, antivirus). |
| **Without Conditional Access** | Devices may be non-compliant but still access corporate resources, reducing security posture. |

> **Note**: Compliance policies alone evaluate device health; Conditional Access enforces access decisions based on that evaluation.

## Conditional Access Policy Settings
CA policies are configured in two main ways:
- **Wizard (Manual setup)** — you build it step by step.
- **Templates (Prebuilt)** — Microsoft provides recommended secure configurations (you can edit them later).

## Wizard
Each wizard step = a part of your policy logic.

### Step 1: Name
Give your policy a clear name that describes what it does.

> **Example**: “Require MFA for External Sign-ins” or “Block Legacy Authentication Clients”

### Step 2: Assignments
Who the policy applies to.
- **All users** – policy applies to everyone.
- **Selected users/groups** – choose specific people or departments.
- **Directory roles** – apply to specific admin roles (like Global Admin, User Admin, etc.).

> **Example**: Apply policy only to “Finance Team” group or “Global Administrators.”

### Step 3: Target Resources
Decide what the policy protects — which apps or actions.

Select what this policy applies to:<br>

**1. Cloud Apps or Resources**
- **All cloud apps** – everything in Microsoft 365 / Azure.
- **Select specific apps** – e.g., SharePoint, Exchange Online.
- **All internet resources** – for Global Secure Access.

> **Example**: Apply policy only for “Microsoft 365 Exchange Online” — so users must meet conditions only when accessing email.

**2. User Actions** These are special actions, not apps:
- Register security info (e.g., setting up MFA)
- Register or join devices (e.g., Azure AD join)

> **Example**: Force MFA when users try to register security info for the first time.

**3. Authentication context**
Used by advanced apps like SharePoint to protect sensitive actions (e.g., downloading confidential files).

### Step 4: Network
Choose which network or location the rule applies to.
- **Include**: any network, trusted networks, compliant networks, selected IPs.
- **Exclude**: e.g., corporate office IPs or trusted VPNs.

> **Example**: Allow login without MFA if user is at office (trusted IP), but require MFA if outside (e.g., coffee shop or home).

### Step 5: Conditions
Fine-tune based on sign-in context.

**1. Device platforms** Choose OS platforms: Android / iOS / Windows / macOS / Linux

> Example:Allow iOS and Android but block Linux devices.

**2. Locations** Choose specific physical/geographic areas or IPs.

> **Example**:Block logins from outside Bangladesh. Or allow only “Trusted Location – Dhaka HQ.”

**3. Client Apps** Choose which client types are affected:
- **Modern clients** (Browser, Outlook, Teams)
- **Legacy clients** (old protocols that don’t support MFA)

      - Block access / Grant access

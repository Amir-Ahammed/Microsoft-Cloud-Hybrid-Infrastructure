# Manage Roles in Intune (Role-Based Access Control in Entra ID)
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is the system used to delegate administrative permissions within Microsoft Intune. It is built on and integrated with Microsoft Entra ID. To ensure the principle of least privilege by granting users or groups only the permissions they absolutely need to perform their jobs.

## Key Capabilities:
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Entra ID uses RBAC to assign permissions based on roles rather than individual user settings. This simplifies management and improves security.
- **Built-in roles**: Microsoft provides over 100 predefined roles like Global Administrator, User Administrator, Application Administrator, and Security Reader. Each has specific permissions tailored to common tasks
- **Custom roles**: Organizations can create custom roles with granular permissions to meet unique operational needs.
- **Role assignment**: Roles can be assigned to users, groups, or service principals. Assignments can be scoped to the entire tenant or limited to specific administrative units or resources.
- **Just-In-Time (JIT) role activation**: Enables time-bound, approval-based access to privileged roles via Entra ID's Privileged Identity Management (PIM), enforcing least privilege with MFA, audit logging, and reduced standing access.
- **Least privilege principle**: Entra ID encourages assigning only the minimum necessary permissions to reduce risk and improve compliance.

## "Privileged" Roles
Roles marked as **Privileged** have elevated access that can impact tenant-wide configurations and security. These roles should be governed with extra caution:

- **Elevated Access**: Can manage sensitive resources like identity settings, enterprise apps, and security configurations.
- **Governance via PIM**: Supports JIT access, approval workflows, and audit trails.
- **Examples**:
  - Global Administrator
  - Application Administrator
  - Security Administrator
  - Privileged Role Administrator

## Common Built-In Roles

| Role Name                      | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Global Administrator**       | Full access to all Entra ID features and settings.                         |
| **User Administrator**         | Manage users, groups, and password resets.                                 |
| **Application Administrator**  | Manage enterprise applications and app registrations.                      |
| **Groups Administrator**       | Create, manage, and delete groups and memberships.                         |
| **Authentication Administrator** | Manage MFA settings and authentication methods.                         |
| **Privileged Role Administrator** | Assign roles and manage role settings.                              |

# Implement compliance policies
# Implement Conditional Access policies
## What is Conditional Access
**Conditional Access (CA)** is a security feature in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) that helps control how users access cloud apps and resources based on specific conditions. When integrated with Intune, it adds device compliance and app management signals to the decision-making process. 
- **Purpose**: Protect organizational resources by allowing access only when specific conditions are met.
- **Signals used**: User/group, device compliance, location, app sensitivity, sign-in risk, etc.

> **Example**: If a user signs in from an unmanaged device or outside the corporate network, require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) before granting access.

## Common Scenarios for Conditional Access
- **Require compliant device**: Only allow access to M365 apps if the device meets Intune compliance policies.
- **Restrict access by location**: Block access from non-corporate or geo-restricted IPs.
- **App-based CA**: Allow access only via approved apps like Outlook mobile.
- **Based on network location**: Allow access only from trusted IP ranges (e.g., corporate VPN or office IPs); block or enforce MFA for unknown networks.
- **Based on device trust**: Grant access only if the device is hybrid Azure AD joined or marked as trusted (e.g., via certificate or compliance state).

## Compliance with or without Conditional Access

| Scenario                    | Behavior                                                                 |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **With Conditional Access**    | Access is granted only if the device is compliant with Intune policies (e.g., encryption, OS version, antivirus). |
| **Without Conditional Access** | Devices may be non-compliant but still access corporate resources, reducing security posture. |

> **Note**: Compliance policies alone evaluate device health; Conditional Access enforces access decisions based on that evaluation.
